Scott Pilgrim is dating a high-schooler?

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,791
Really? Is she hot?

3
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,210
How old are you now, Scott? Like, 28?

4
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,129
I'm not playing your little games, kids.

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,590
So, you've been out of high
school for, like, 13 years.

6
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,552
I'm 22. Twenty-two.

7
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,930
And you're dating a high-school
girl. Not bad, not bad.

8
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,849
Thank you, thank you.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,854
So, did you guys, like,
you know, do it yet?

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,731
We have done many things.

11
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,483
We ride the bus together.

12
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,695
And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,240
and about her friends
and, you know, drama.

14
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,700
Have you even kissed her?

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,161
We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.

16
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,579
Well, aren't you pleased as punch.

17
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,624
So, what's her name?

19
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,377
Knives Chau.

20
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,171
She's Chinese.

21
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,464
Wicked.

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,715
So, when do we get to meet her?

23
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,592
Oh, please, let it be soon.

24
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,054
That's for me.

25
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,932
Hi. You promise to be good?

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,266
Of course I'll be good.

27
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,726
Seriously, please be good.

28
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,728
Am I normally not?

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,607
Hey, Knives, this is Stephen
Stills. He's the talent.

30
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,026
Hey.

31
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,111
Is she gonna geek out on us?

32
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,529
She'll just sit in the corner, man.

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,447
I mean, I want her to geek out on us.

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,742
She'll geek. She geeks. She
has the capacity to geek.

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,245
Okay.

36
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,498
You're good.

37
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,876
Wow.

38
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,003
Here, let me get your coat.

39
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,295
Hi.

40
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,840
Knives, that's Kim.

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,383
Sorry, what was your name?

42
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,426
Kim.

43
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,761
And you play the drums?

44
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,887
Yes.

45
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,973
That is so awesome.

46
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,975
Knives, that's Young Neil.

47
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,393
Hi.

48
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,769
Hi.

49
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,564
What do you play?

50
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:31,609
/Wow, Zelda, Tetris.

51
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,823
That's kind of a big question.

52
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,242
/Okay, let's start with
/Launchpad McQuack.

53
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,827
That's not the actual title of the...

54
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,662
We are Sex Bob-Omb!

55
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,916
One, two, three, four!

56
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,256
/Yeah, yeah

57
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,550
/Yeah, yeah

58
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,886
/Laminate the stasis

59
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,764
/Mama, mama serpentine

60
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,433
/I got a breathalyzer

61
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,479
/And my body's clean

62
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,196
/Yeah! Yeah!

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,807
/Thank you!

64
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,038
/Get ready

65
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,125
/Yeah

66
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,100
/Yeah, yeah

67
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,228
/Yeah, yeah

68
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,443
/Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

69
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,070
/Yeah!

70
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,244
You guys are so

71
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,248
amazing.

72
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,750
She seems nice. Yeah.

73
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,126
Yeah, she seems awesome.

74
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,210
Yeah.

75
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,755
Scott, if your life had
a face, I would punch it.

76
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,882
Yeah. Wait, what?

77
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,510
I mean, are you really happy
or are you really evil?

78
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,346
Like, do I have ulterior
motives or something?

79
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,555
I'm offended, Kim.

80
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,307
Wounded, even?

81
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,433
Hurt, Kim.

82
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,144
You? Hurt?

83
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,772
Neil, you were saying
about "she seems awesome. "

84
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,231
Yeah, she seems awesome.

85
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,776
Yeah.

86
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,740
Before you hear some dirty
lies from someone else,

87
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,909
yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old.

88
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,078
Oh, is he cute?

89
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,413
Does this mean we have to
stop sleeping together?

90
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,916
You see another bed in here?

91
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:38,755
Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.

92
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,056
So, the whole 17-year-old thing,
don't tell too many people.

93
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,849
Hey, you know me.

94
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,894
I mean, don't tell my sister.

95
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,145
You know me.

96
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,982
Who are you texting?

97
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,943
Seventeen years old? Scandal!

98
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,736
That's not true. Who told you?

99
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,821
Wallace. Duh.

100
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,489
That gossipy bitch.

101
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,615
You know me.

102
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,158
Wallace!

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,827
Who is this mystery child you date?

104
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,746
Her name's Knives Chau. She's Chinese.

105
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,376
A 17-year-old Chinese
schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

106
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,003
It's a Catholic school, too.

107
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,462
With the uniform and everything?

108
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,881
Yeah. The whole deal.

109
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,466
Oh, my God. You guys haven't...

110
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,302
No, no, no, no. We haven't
even held hands yet.

111
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,388
I think she hugged me once.

112
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,515
Scott, why are you doing this?

113
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,269
I don't know. It's just nice,
you know? It's just simple.

114
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,770
It's been over a year
since you got dumped

115
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,566
by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named. So...

116
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,859
Are you legitimately moving on

117
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,986
or is this just you being insane?

118
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,657
Can I get back to you on that?

119
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,160
I do not wanna be here at all.

120
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,203
This school has boys, too.

121
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,374
I hate you. Even I would think
twice about dating a 17-year-old.

122
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,667
Well, she's only allowed out

123
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,253
when the sun is up, so I
wouldnâ€™t call it dating.

124
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,172
It's more like... Playtime?

125
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,923
That doesn't sound so good, either. No.

126
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,508
Scott!

127
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,593
Hey, Knives.

128
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,762
This is my cool, gay
roommate, Wallace Wells.

129
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,221
Hi. He's gay.

130
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,766
Oh, do you wanna know
who in my class is gay?

131
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,351
Yes, does he wear glasses?

132
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:19,105
Wallace, you go now. Begone.

133
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:24,027
You're too good for him. Run.

134
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,738
/Get ready!

135
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,991
/Here we go!

136
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,830
/Did you know that the original
/name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?

137
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,707
You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,

138
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,210
/but it actually comes from the
/Japanese phrase "paku-paku, "

139
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,713
which means, "to flap one's
mouth open and closed. "

140
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,881
They changed it because
they thought that

141
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,716
/"Puck-Man" would be
/too easy to vandalize.

142
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,884
You know, people could just scratch off

143
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,136
the "P" and turn it into
an "F" or whatever.

144
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,348
Oh, my God! Like, wow!

145
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,101
/Combo!

146
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,312
Yeah. Wow.

147
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,438
/Continue?

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,902
/Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

149
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,278
/three... Oh, I got it.

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,615
/...two, one.

151
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,452
I don't listen to that much music.

152
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,331
I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...

153
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,333
You guys rock.

154
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,918
Well, I knew I personally rocked,

155
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,587
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

156
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,839
So, thank you, Knives.

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,550
I mean, you guys are gonna be huge.

158
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,010
Well, we're already pretty big,

159
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,594
but, yeah, I guess it'd be cool

160
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,930
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

161
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,724
Cool. Yeah, yeah.

162
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,102
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

163
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,605
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

164
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,232
Thank you, Julie.

165
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,775
Are you coming to my party Friday,

166
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,237
or will you be busy babysitting?

167
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,489
Thank you, Julie.

168
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,575
You don't want to listen to her.

169
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,994
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

170
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,787
Oh, I heart them so much.

171
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,374
Yeah, I hearted them, too, until
they signed to a major label,

172
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,170
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

173
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,796
But that's just me.

174
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,300
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

175
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,926
Sorry, you were saying about me?

176
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,096
I mean, I've never gone out
with anyone so talented.

177
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,306
Go out with a lot of guys?

178
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,515
No.

179
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,809
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

180
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,731
I've never even kissed a guy.

181
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,484
Hey,

182
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,737
me, neither.

183
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,457
Here you go.

184
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,875
So, this is your secret lair?

185
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,127
Yeah, yeah. Can I come in?

186
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,755
My secret lair is one of those

187
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,757
"No girls allowed"- type deals.

188
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,925
Okay.

189
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,510
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

190
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,971
Sure! Come on.

191
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,849
There you go.

192
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,518
Wow.

193
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,561
Yeah.

194
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,022
Wow.

195
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,240
Oh, God.

196
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,494
So alone.

197
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,413
You're not alone.

198
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,747
What?

199
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,501
You're just having some idiotic dream.

200
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,211
Does that mean we can make out?

201
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,088
Oh, God!

202
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,214
What is it, Scott?

203
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,424
I had this totally weird dream.

204
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,717
Oh, God.

205
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,093
What is it, Other Scott?

206
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,430
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

207
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,848
But there was this girl.

208
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,182
Girt?

209
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,726
Was this an Envy-related dream?

210
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,394
We don't use the E-word in this house.

211
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,564
No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new.

212
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,607
Yay for that.

213
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,900
Speaking of new,

214
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,861
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

215
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,779
to the library a half-hour ago?

216
00:10:54,821 --> 00:11:00,118
What? It's like 6:00 in the morning.

217
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,578
Shh!

218
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,954
It's weird.

219
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,581
What's weird?

220
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,417
Libraries remind me of grade school.

221
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,919
That must seem like a
really long time ago.

222
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:15,759
Yeah, let's talk about something else.

223
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,736
Do you know that girl?

224
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,613
Scott! What?

225
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,033
You only played one note
for that entire song.

226
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,201
My hand slipped.

227
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,078
Is your girlfriend distracting you?

228
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,871
My girlfriend?

229
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,332
I'll be quieter.

230
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,708
Let's do that one again.

231
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,001
Sorry, what are we doing?

232
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,419
I told you, like, 50 times!

233
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,296
We're going to this party, retard.

234
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,548
Party? At Julie's.

235
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,633
I thought you guys split up.

236
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,177
We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...

237
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,137
Oh, man, this is gonna suck. Suck!

238
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,390
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

239
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,557
Oh, man!

240
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,767
This sucks!

241
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,935
Sucks!

242
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,064
I'm gonna go pee due to boredom.

243
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,607
I have to pee.

244
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,275
You know, so I told him you've
got a really good sound,

245
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,819
and I think that you
should market your sound

246
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,363
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

247
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,447
Hey, Comeau.

248
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,324
How about this party? You
getting your drink on here?

249
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,243
No, I don't drink. This
is just Coke Zero.

250
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,619
What do you mean, you don't drink?

251
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,038
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

252
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,498
Hey, Comeau, you know everyone, right?

253
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,834
Yeah, pretty much, I do.

254
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,377
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

255
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,878
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

256
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,964
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

257
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,340
What? Oh, Scott.

258
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,509
You have the hots for her or
something? I gotta tell you though,

259
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,140
I hear that she's a little hardcore.

260
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,429
Hey, what's up?

261
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,513
Nothing.

262
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,890
/Hey, you know Pac-Man?

263
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,683
I know of him.

264
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,979
/Well, Pac-Man was
/originally called Puck-Man.

265
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,731
They changed it because...

266
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,900
Not because Pac-Man
looks like a hockey puck.

267
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,402
/"Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth,"

268
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,072
and that they were afraid
people would change...

269
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:48,078
Scratch out the "P" and turn
it into an "F," like...

270
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,288
Yeah, that's amazing.

271
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,499
Um...

272
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,960
Am I dreaming?

273
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,796
I'll leave you alone forever now.

274
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,548
Thanks.

275
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,472
Dude! What?

276
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,807
She's totally real! Who?

277
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,433
Ramona Flowers. What?

278
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,602
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

279
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,312
All I know is that she is American.

280
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,438
American.

281
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,940
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

282
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,108
They know a lot more.

283
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,276
Lady-dudes. What do you
know about Ramona Flowers?

284
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,653
I heard she has a boyfriend.

285
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,279
Yeah. Some guy back in New York.

286
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,948
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?

287
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,450
I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.

288
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,036
She's on another level.

289
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,996
She has men dying at her feet.

290
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,749
She's got some battle scars, dude.

291
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,292
What about Ramona Flowers?

292
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,377
You know her? Tell me now.

293
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,461
She just moved here.

294
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,088
Got a job at Amazon. Comes into my work.

295
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,131
Does she really?

296
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,882
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

297
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,009
Did she really?

298
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,343
They had a huge fight, or whatever.

299
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,428
Did they really?

300
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,888
Yes! But I didn't want
Scott to know that, Stephen.

301
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,932
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

302
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,184
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

303
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,479
even if you haven't had a real
girlfriend in over a year.

304
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,066
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

305
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,735
He's totally dating a high-schooler.

306
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,778
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

307
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,988
She's got a point.

308
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,156
I thought you guys broke up.

309
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,992
I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.

310
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,661
We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

311
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,163
That's completely untrue.

312
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,040
That time with Lisa? That
was a misunderstanding.

313
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,042
That time with Hollie? That
wasn't what it looked like.

314
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,168
That time you dumped Kim for...

315
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,713
Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?

316
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,841
Whatever! Ramona's out of your
league. Let's just leave it at that.

317
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,218
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

318
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,471
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

319
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,097
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

320
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,851
Forget it, Scott!

321
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,355
Guess who's drunk?

322
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,857
I guess Wallace.

323
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,486
You guess right.

324
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,030
So, that girl from my dream...

325
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,365
Girl. Okay.

326
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,866
I saw her at the library.

327
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,577
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

328
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,538
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

329
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,873
Hey, there he is.

330
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:57,916
I think she's...

331
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,042
I think he's...

332
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,252
I think she's the girl of my dreams.

333
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,420
Mmm.

334
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,798
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

335
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,591
I've never been so sure about something.

336
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,427
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

337
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,553
What's that?

338
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,556
You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.

339
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,685
I'm not getting it, friend.

340
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,977
You're thinking of juggling two chicks?

341
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,104
Not even!

342
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,523
Well, you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

343
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,649
Wait, who told you?

344
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,025
Wallace. Duh!

345
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,819
He's not even conscious. Whatever.

346
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,822
You of all people should know how
sucky it is to get cheated on.

347
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,073
Don't you have a job to do?

348
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:36,287
You're right. I should send out
a mass text about this. Bye.

349
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,081
Wallace, how do you do that?

350
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,250
Wallace!

351
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,711
Amazon.ca, what's the website for that?

352
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,921
"Amazon.ca. "

353
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,257
I have to order something really cool.

354
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,009
/You've got mail.

355
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,719
Dude, this thing claims I have mail.

356
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,263
It's amazing what we can do
with computers these days.

357
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,597
Dude, now I'm reading it.

358
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,599
So happy for you.

359
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,643
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, it
has come to my attention

360
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,061
"that we will be fighting soon.

361
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,773
"My name is Matthew Patel,
and... " Blah, blah, blah...

362
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:09,029
/"Fair warning... Mano y mano...
/Seven evil... " Blah, blah.

363
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:14,284
This is... This is... This is...

364
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,702
What?

365
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,038
This is boring.

366
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,790
Delete.

367
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,587
Scott,

368
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,548
are you waiting for the
package you just ordered?

369
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,841
Maybe.

370
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,969
It's the weekend. It won't ship
until Monday at the earliest.

371
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,555
You were saying?

372
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,681
Attack hug! Hey!

373
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,809
Attack hug. That's so cute. So cute.

374
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:40,894
You don't remember?

375
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,980
You're supposed to meet me at
the bus stop a half-hour ago.

376
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,901
How could I possibly forget?

377
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,778
Yearbook club is so boring.

378
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,113
I cannot believe the music
they put on while we work.

379
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,198
That's sucky.

380
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,451
Hannah broke up with Alan
and now she's all into Derek.

381
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,828
But then Tamara claims
she has dibs on Derek.

382
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,539
I tell you.

383
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,375
/Bad!

384
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,168
/Bad!

385
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,504
/Bad!

386
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,339
/Bad!

387
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,423
/Bad!

388
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,759
Okay. I'm sorry, that was all me.

389
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,886
/Solo round!

390
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,346
Uh-oh.

391
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,555
Nega ninja.

392
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,391
/Nega ninja!

393
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,976
I can never get past that guy.

394
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,603
Don't beat yourself up about it.

395
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:24,854
/Game over!

396
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,232
Do you want to keep going?

397
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,693
/Continue? Nine, eight,

398
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,862
/seven, six, five... I think...

399
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:33,988
/...four, three...

400
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,365
I think that we should...

401
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,702
/...two, one.

402
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,377
/Game on, everybody. Game on.

403
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,586
/I got us a show.

404
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,005
Oh, my gosh, when?

405
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,339
Wednesday.

406
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,050
The Rockit. And even
better, it's the T.I.B.B.

407
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,135
Whoa!

408
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,720
The Toronto International
Battle of the Bands?

409
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,804
That's right.

410
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,432
This guy at work was like, "Steve,
you know anybody in a band?"

411
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,225
And I was like, "I'm in a band. "

412
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,977
And he was like, "You're in a band?"

413
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,396
And I was like, "Yeah, I
am totally in a band. "

414
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,564
Great story, man.

415
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,232
Is there a prize or something?

416
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,110
Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.

417
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,029
Who's that? You don't know?

418
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,072
Indie producer of the millennium.

419
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,198
Oh.

420
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,995
If we win, it won't just be Knives
wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts.

421
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,664
It'll be the cool kids, too.

422
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,749
I promise

423
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,420
I will do everything I can to get
out of the study group and come.

424
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,255
I have to pee.

425
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,424
Oh, my gosh, who are you battling?

426
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,675
Crash and the Boys.

427
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,470
That one band with
Crash, and those boys?

428
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,721
Yeah, that's the one.

429
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,930
I hate them.

430
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,307
Oh, my gosh, I hate them, too.

431
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,433
Yeah, they suck.

432
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,895
They suck bad.

433
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,963
Hey!

434
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,724
Hey!

435
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,688
Uh, Scott Pilgrim?

436
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,398
Hi, I was thinking about asking you out,

437
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,441
but then I realized how
stupid that would be.

438
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,568
So, do you want to go out sometime?

439
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,987
No, that's okay. You can just
sign for this, all right?

440
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,031
I just woke up, and
you were in my dream.

441
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,118
I dreamt that you were delivering
me this package. Is that weird?

442
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,285
It's not weird at all.

443
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,370
It's not?

444
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,746
No, it's just that you have
this really convenient

445
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,832
subspace highway running through
your head that I like to use.

446
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,458
It's, like, three miles in 15 seconds.

447
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,501
Right, right.

448
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,586
I forgot you guys don't
have that in Canada.

449
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,671
You don't remember me, do you?

450
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,047
We met at the party the other day.

451
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,924
/Were you the Pac-Man guy? No.

452
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,135
Not even. That was some total ass.

453
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,678
I was the other guy.

454
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,014
You know, you need to sign
for this, whatever this is.

455
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,223
But if I sign for it, you'll leave.

456
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,433
Yeah, it's how it works.

457
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,435
Okay, well, maybe,

458
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,312
do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?

459
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,356
You're the new kid on the block, right?

460
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:20,071
I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.

461
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,158
You want me to hang out with you?

462
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,160
Yeah, if that's cool.

463
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,539
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

464
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:33,084
So, yeah, 8:00?

465
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,254
Why are you just standing there?

466
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,256
Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

467
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,842
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

468
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,845
Oh, you assumed wrong.

469
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,139
So, how did you end up in Toronto?

470
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,599
Just needed to escape, I guess.

471
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,017
Yeah.

472
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,727
I got this job here, and
Gideon had always said

473
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,271
Toronto was one of the
great cities, so...

474
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,648
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

475
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,110
He's a friend.

476
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,488
Was he your boyfriend?

477
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,740
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

478
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,576
It's so not interesting to me.

479
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,037
So, what about you? What do you do?

480
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,206
I'm in between jobs at the moment.

481
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,291
Between what and what?

482
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,797
Well, my last job was a long
story filled with sighs.

483
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,674
I know plenty of those.

484
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,008
Is that why you left New York?

485
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,677
Pretty much.

486
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,262
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

487
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,972
Well, it's certainly chilled here.

488
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,265
Yeah.

489
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,851
It's chilled, as in cold.

490
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,396
Yeah.

491
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,650
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, April?

492
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,818
I know.

493
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,861
I can barely see you.

494
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,614
This whole thing is an
unmitigated disaster.

495
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:48,535
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

496
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,537
So this is a date, eh?

497
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,956
Did I say date?

498
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,499
Slip of the tongue.

499
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,126
Tongue.

500
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,753
Anyway, night's not over yet.

501
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,755
I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.

502
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,757
A thingy?

503
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,510
A door.

504
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,640
Come on.

505
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,281
What kind of tea do you want?

506
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,783
There's more than one kind?

507
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,369
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

508
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,579
green tea, green tea with lemon,

509
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,164
green tea with lemon and
honey, liver disaster,

510
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,582
ginger with honey, ginger without honey,

511
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,625
vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,

512
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,253
vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment

513
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:41,963
and Earl Grey.

514
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,007
Did you make some of those up?

515
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,176
I think I'll have Sleepytime.

516
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,763
That sounds good to me.

517
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,264
Let me get you a blanket.

518
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:56,394
That would actually be awesome.

519
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,613
Dude, I'm changing.

520
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,907
Sorry. I'm just cold.

521
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,034
Here, does that help?

522
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,579
Yeah, that's very warm. What is that?

523
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,123
Okay.

524
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,767
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

525
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,102
I guess.

526
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:43,024
Maybe we should both get
under it, since we're so cold.

527
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,903
What about our tea?

528
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,322
I can

529
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,659
not have tea.

530
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,709
I changed my mind.

531
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,420
Changed it to what? From what?

532
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,965
I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

533
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,883
Okay.

534
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,261
It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.

535
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,846
You can sleep in my bed.

536
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,807
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

537
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,477
Well, this is nice. Just this.

538
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,022
It's been, like, a really long time,

539
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,524
so I think I needed
this, whatever it is,

540
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,861
so thank you.

541
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,073
You're welcome.

542
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,995
Hey, so, can this not
be a one-night stand?

543
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,749
For one thing, I didn't even
get any. That was a joke.

544
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,542
What did you have in mind?

545
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,045
Come to the first round of this
Battle of the Bands thing.

546
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,338
You have a band?

547
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,298
Yeah, we're terrible. Please, come?

548
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,133
Sure.

549
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:54,471
Oh! Wait. Can I get your number?

550
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,182
Wow. Girl number.

551
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,476
See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.

552
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:04,314
Hey, it's tonight. At the...

553
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:09,152
Hey. You totally came.

554
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:13,573
Yes. I did totally come.

555
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,662
Please excuse my brother. He
is chronically enfeebled.

556
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,164
I'm Stacey. Hey.

557
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,832
This is Wallace, his roommate. Hey.

558
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,167
This is my boyfriend, Jimmy.

559
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,794
Hey.

560
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,337
Oh, and this is Knives.

561
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,298
Hey! Hey!

562
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,470
So, do you like?

563
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,515
Well, I...

564
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,069
Have to go.

565
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:56,199
/Okay, this next band is from Brampton,

566
00:26:56,241 --> 00:27:00,954
/and they are Crash and the Boys.

567
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,873
God! This is a nightmare.

568
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,292
Is this a nightmare? Wake
up, wake up, wake up!

569
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,752
Once we're on stage, you'll be fine.

570
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:11,256
We were just on stage for sound
check, and the sound guy hated us.

571
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,551
It's just nerves. Pre-show jitters.

572
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,802
People love us, right?

573
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,595
Oh, man, this is bad.

574
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,889
This is so, so bad.

575
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:23,935
Hey, Jimmy, do they rock or suck?

576
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,272
They have not started playing yet.

577
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,399
- /That was a test, Jimmy.
- One, two.

578
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,900
You passed.

579
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,360
Okay.

580
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,695
/Good evening.

581
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,072
/My name is Crash. These are the Boys.

582
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,866
Is that girl a boy, too?

583
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,410
/Yes.

584
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,203
They have a girl drummer?

585
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:46,833
/This song is called I Am So
/Sad, I Am So Very Very Sad.

586
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:51,004
/Goes a little something like this.

587
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,840
/So sad!

588
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,134
/Thank you.

589
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,428
It's not a race, guys.

590
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,013
/All right, this next
/song goes out to the guy

591
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,639
/who keeps yelling from the balcony.

592
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,767
/It's called We Hate You, Please Die.

593
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,896
Sweet. Love this one.

594
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:21,868
/I can feel ya, I can hear ya...

595
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,299
/Thank you.

596
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,969
So, how do you know Scott?

597
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,514
He's a friend.

598
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,182
It's hard for me to
keep track sometimes,

599
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,727
because he has so many friends.

600
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,106
Knives, how did you meet Scott?

601
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,108
Well...

602
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,944
/Oh, no.

603
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:00,490
/This is a nightmare.

604
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,826
We need to play now and loud.

605
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:03,993
Okay.

606
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:09,290
So, I was on the bus with my mom...

607
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,668
Is that seriously the end of the story?

608
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,877
Oh, my gosh!

609
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,962
/Okay.

610
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,130
They're on!

611
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,090
/This next band is from Toronto.

612
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:22,721
/And, yeah. Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.

613
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:27,267
I heart you, Sex Bob-Omb!

614
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,601
Scott, are you ready?

615
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,145
Okay. Kim? Are you...

616
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:36,401
We are Sex Bob-Omb!
One, two, three, four!

617
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,452
/I'll take you for a ride

618
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:49,497
/On my garbage truck

619
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,542
/Oh, no

620
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:56,713
/I'll take you to the dump

621
00:29:56,755 --> 00:30:00,383
/'Cause you're my queen

622
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:04,012
/I'll take you uptown

623
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:09,225
/I'll show you the sites
/You know you wanna ride

624
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:12,645
/On my garbage truck

625
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,689
/Truck, truck, truck

626
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,692
/We'll pass the mansions by

627
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:21,196
/Drive right through the needle's eye

628
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,364
/Oh, my

629
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,573
/Oh, no... My...

630
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:27,118
/My, my, my, my

631
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:32,040
/I've got a stereo

632
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:35,085
/You've just got to turn the knob

633
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:38,421
/And maybe we'll go

634
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,466
/As far as we can

635
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:45,261
/I'll be your garbage man

636
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,765
/I'll take out your junk

637
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,102
/And I'll crush it...

638
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:55,105
Mr. Pilgrim.

639
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:59,442
It is I, Matthew Patel.

640
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:04,114
Consider our fight begun.

641
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,783
What did I do?

642
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,120
What do I do?

643
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,248
Fight!

644
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:27,137
All right.

645
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,389
All right.

646
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:34,310
Watch out! It's that one guy.

647
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,385
Well, well, well,

648
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:10,472
you're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

649
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,015
Who the hell are you, anyway?

650
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:15,352
My name is Matthew Patel!

651
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:21,483
And I'm Ramona's first
evil ex-boyfriend.

652
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,278
Her what?

653
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,908
Anyone need another drink?

654
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:41,086
Wait. We're fighting over Ramona?

655
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:44,089
Didn't you get my e-mail
explaining the situation?

656
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,423
I skimmed it.

657
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,549
Mmm-mmm.

658
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:51,805
You will pay for your insolence!

659
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,287
Hey, what's up with his outfit?

660
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,416
Yeah, is he a pirate?

661
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,625
Are you a pirate?

662
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:25,171
Pirates are in this year.

663
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,556
You really went out with this guy?

664
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,933
Yeah.

665
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:40,103
In the seventh grade.

666
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:42,564
And?

667
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,444
It was football season
and for some reason,

668
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:50,655
all the little jocks wanted me.

669
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,908
/Matthew was the only non-white,
/non-jock boy in town.

670
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,620
/So, the two of us joined forces
/and we took 'em all down.

671
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:01,291
/We brawled and scrapped
/and fought for hours.

672
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:04,753
/Nothing could beat
/Matthew's mystical powers.

673
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,296
We only kissed once.

674
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,799
After a week and a half, I
told him to hit the showers.

675
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:14,596
Dude, wait. Mystical powers?

676
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:18,933
You'll pay for this, Flowers.

677
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,936
/If you want to fight me

678
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,229
What?

679
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:26,399
/Ha! You're not the brightest

680
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:33,031
/You won't know what
/hit you in the slightest

681
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,494
This guy's good.

682
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:40,830
/Me and my fireballs

683
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,916
/My Demon Hipster Chicks

684
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,001
Tell him, Matty. Tell him, Matty.

685
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:46,503
/I'm talking the talk

686
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,631
/Because I know I'm slick

687
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,883
/S-L-ick

688
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:53,718
/Fireballs

689
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,972
/Take this sucker down

690
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:04,354
/Let us show him what we're all about

691
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:08,775
That doesn't even rhyme.

692
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,737
/This is impossible. How can this be?

693
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:18,159
/Open your eyes, maybe you'll see.

694
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,912
/K-O!

695
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,921
Sweet! Coins.

696
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,716
God, is that allowed?

697
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:35,385
Well, it was nice meeting you.

698
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:37,929
Tell your gay friends I said bye.

699
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,640
Gay friends?

700
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,308
Wallace! Again?

701
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,936
- Get a room, guys!
- Oh, my God!

702
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,606
Oh, man, $2.40? That's not
even enough for the bus home.

703
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,900
I'll lend you the 35 cents.

704
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:55,739
/Yeah, so, Sex Bob-Omb wins.

705
00:35:56,448 --> 00:36:00,035
Sex Bob-Omb won?

706
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:10,670
So, what was all that all about?

707
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,798
I guess

708
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,385
if we're gonna date, you may have
to defeat my seven evil exes.

709
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:18,720
You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?

710
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,971
Seven evil exes, yes.

711
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,598
And I have to fight... Defeat.

712
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,186
Defeat your seven evil exes if
we're going to continue to date?

713
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,312
Pretty much.

714
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:34,361
So, what you're saying
right now is we are dating?

715
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,445
I guess.

716
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,947
Does that mean we can make out?

717
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:38,990
Sure.

718
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,241
Cool.

719
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:42,577
Aw!

720
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,128
Someone's happy.

721
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,589
Well, someone got to
second base last night.

722
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,926
And someone has a second date tonight.

723
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,929
Someone's lucky, then.

724
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,806
You know when I say "someone,"
I mean "me," right?

725
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:05,642
I got to second base last night.

726
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:09,312
Maybe first-and-a-half.

727
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:13,942
So, I invited Ramona over for dinner
tonight, so you can't be here.

728
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:17,404
I don't want you gaying up the place.

729
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,781
Okay, Scott.

730
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,158
But in return, I have
to issue an ultimatum.

731
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,660
One of your famous ultimatums?

732
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,538
It may live in infamy.

733
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:32,627
You have to break up with
Knives, that poor angel, today.

734
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,921
But it's hard.

735
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,465
If you don't, I'm going to
tell Ramona about Knives.

736
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:38,550
I swear to God, Scott.

737
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,427
What? You...

738
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:41,511
Hi. Morning.

739
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,263
Hey, Jimmy. Double standard!

740
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,764
I didn't make up the gay rulebook.

741
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,307
You got a problem with it... Stop.

742
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:47,809
Take it up with Liberace's ghost.

743
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,935
You're a monster.

744
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,687
Give me the bacon, and go do your dirt

745
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:51,980
while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.

746
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,273
Who's Lucas Lee?

747
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,025
Oh!

748
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,568
He was this pretty good skater.

749
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,028
Now he's this pretty good actor.

750
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,155
He's filming a Winifred Hailey
movie in Toronto right now.

751
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:01,364
They make movies in Toronto?

752
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,532
Yes.

753
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm stalking him later.

754
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:05,243
So, this Lucas Lee...

755
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:10,331
Lucas Lee is not important
to you right now. Get out.

756
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,541
You suck.

757
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,917
Out.

758
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,044
Surprising no one.

759
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:16,504
Out.

760
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,175
/Now, you listen close,
/and you listen hard, bucko.

761
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,677
/The next click you'll
/hear is me hanging up.

762
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:29,434
/The one after that is
/me pulling the trigger.

763
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,771
Hey, Knives.

764
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:35,565
Hey, do you wanna,
like, talk or whatever?

765
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:41,571
/Are you wearing a tan jacket,
/like, a spring jacket, and a hoodie?

766
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,573
/And a dorky hat?

767
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,742
It's not dorky. Why are you psychic?

768
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:46,868
Hey!

769
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,788
Hey. Hey.

770
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,248
Hey.

771
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,292
Oh, my God.

772
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:58,380
I can't believe TCAD's coming to
town. Will you take me to the show?

773
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,757
Yeah, listen...

774
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,552
Hey, I wanted to invite
you over for dinner.

775
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:06,346
Like, Chinese food?

776
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,182
To meet my parents. It's
my birthday dinner.

777
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:12,185
I think that's a really bad idea.

778
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,771
No, it's okay. Why?

779
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,439
I'm too old for you.

780
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:19,776
No, you're not. My dad is
nine years older than my mom.

781
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:23,113
Are you even allowed to date
outside your race or whatever?

782
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:27,158
I don't care. I'm...

783
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,286
I'm in...

784
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,043
Uh...

785
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,713
Listen,

786
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,799
I was thinking

787
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:47,929
we should break up or whatever.

788
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:49,723
Really?

789
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,100
Yeah.

790
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:56,521
It's not gonna work out.

791
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,149
Oh.

792
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,512
Where's Knives. Not coming tonight?

793
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:30,597
No, we broke up.

794
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:38,605
/Hey, check it out, I learned the
/bass line from Final Fantasy II.

795
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,607
Scott, you are the salt of the earth.

796
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,192
Thanks.

797
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,902
I meant scum of the earth.

798
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,028
Thanks.

799
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,446
You broke up with Knives?

800
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,323
Yeah, but don't worry.

801
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,867
Maybe soon you'll meet
my new-new girlfriend.

802
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,703
New-new.

803
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:58,500
Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends
or girlfriend talk at practice.

804
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,210
Whether they're old, new, or

805
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,419
New-new. New-new.

806
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,838
We were lucky to survive the last round.

807
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,548
It's sudden death now, okay?

808
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,093
Okay.

809
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,809
That's for me. That's
for me. That's for me.

810
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,562
Hey, you're here.

811
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:22,941
Yes, like you said.

812
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,067
You know your hair?

813
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,151
I know of it.

814
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:26,403
It's all blue.

815
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:30,573
I change my hair every week and
a half, dude. Get used to it.

816
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:33,118
So...

817
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:35,787
How do you guys all know each other?

818
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,081
High school, I guess.

819
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:39,541
What Neil said.

820
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:40,750
I'm Neil.

821
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,712
Believe it or not, I actually
dated Scott in high school.

822
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,296
Got any embarrassing stories?

823
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:47,257
Yeah, he's an idiot.

824
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,092
Okay, bye. See you guys tomorrow.

825
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,260
What about rehearsal?

826
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:53,346
Neil knows my parts.

827
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:56,307
I'm Neil.

828
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,190
You doing okay, there?

829
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:08,528
Yeah, good, good, good.

830
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,363
She changed her hair.

831
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,614
So? It looks nice blue.

832
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,116
Yeah, I know, but she did
it without even making

833
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,325
a big deal of it or anything.

834
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:17,287
She's fickle. Impulsive. Spontaneous.

835
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,997
God, what am I gonna do?

836
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,043
Can't believe you're worried
about me gaying up the place.

837
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:25,045
So, how's dinner coming along?

838
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:28,423
Yeah, good, good, good.

839
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:31,551
Okay, well, I'm gonna
leave you lovebirds to it.

840
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:35,263
I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.

841
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:36,348
Don't go!

842
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,807
Will you man the hell up?

843
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:39,309
You can get to second
and a half base tonight.

844
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:40,477
You think so?

845
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:43,688
Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.

846
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,814
If I strike out?

847
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:49,444
Okay, when. See you in 60.

848
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:52,739
This is actually really
good garlic bread.

849
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:54,407
Garlic bread is my favorite food.

850
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,409
I could honestly eat it for every meal.

851
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:58,995
Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.

852
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,163
You'd get fat.

853
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:01,331
No, why would I get fat?

854
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:02,499
Bread makes you fat.

855
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,544
Bread makes you fat?

856
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:07,879
I wrote a song about you.

857
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,005
You did?

858
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,799
Yeah, it goes like this.

859
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,551
/Ramona

860
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:20,100
/Ramona

861
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,146
/On my mind

862
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,358
/Ramona

863
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,200
Can't wait to hear it
when it's finished.

864
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:40,161
Finished?

865
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,543
Your hair's pretty shaggy.

866
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:48,628
Oh, God, I need a haircut, don't I?

867
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,713
What?

868
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:51,339
No, sorry. I just...

869
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:54,884
I got a bad haircut right before
me and my big ex broke up,

870
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:57,512
but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.

871
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:00,348
/Scott is acutely aware that his
/last salon haircut took place

872
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,227
/exactly 431 days ago, three
/hours before his big breakup.

873
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,521
/He's been cutting his
/own hair ever since.

874
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:09,065
So long ago.

875
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,400
Sounds like a bad time.

876
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:12,277
Bad time? Not really.

877
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:13,445
/It was.

878
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:14,738
It was a mutual thing.

879
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:15,905
/It wasn't.

880
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:18,950
I mean, she told me it was mutual.

881
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,411
/She dumped him. It was brutal.

882
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:22,746
What was her name?

883
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,080
She was Nat, when I knew her,

884
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,249
but she stopped liking that name.

885
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,001
Then she stopped liking me.

886
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:29,961
Your hair is cute. I like it long.

887
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,838
But it would be cuter
short, wouldnâ€™t it?

888
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,424
What? What?

889
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,508
Why are you wearing that hat?

890
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,470
I thought we could go for a walk.

891
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:39,971
Tell me we didn't come
out here in the cold

892
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,348
so you could cover your
hair with that hat.

893
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:44,059
No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.

894
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,105
Just putting one leg in front of
the other, like this. Walking.

895
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:51,858
You seem a little heightened.

896
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,276
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

897
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,945
I just sort of feel like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.

898
00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:57,572
Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,

899
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,532
in which case I do drugs all the time.

900
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,326
Every drug.

901
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,371
Yeah, I don't know.
Just when I'm with you,

902
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:07,165
things sort of seem a little brighter.

903
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,291
What is this place?

904
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,959
It's a totally awesome castle.

905
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:11,586
They're shooting this
movie here right now.

906
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,297
/Okay, everybody, let's do
/this. Lots to do, everyone.

907
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,340
Lots to do.

908
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,175
Did you find the guy you were stalking?

909
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,927
I think I'm about to right now.

910
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:20,595
Mr. Lee is traveling.

911
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:21,680
Mr. Lee?

912
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:23,139
Lucas Lee.

913
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:24,641
Oh.

914
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:25,892
Oh?

915
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:29,521
/And roll sound.

916
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:37,654
I wanna have his adopted babies.

917
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,532
/Here we go.

918
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:42,325
/All right, on your marks, everyone.

919
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:43,910
Oh, man, we got to go.

920
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,120
What? Why?

921
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,497
I used to date that clown.

922
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:48,581
And...

923
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:50,000
Action.

924
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,668
Oh, my God.

925
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,545
Hey.

926
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:55,338
The only thing keeping me and her apart

927
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,674
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

928
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,467
You dated a famous guy?

929
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:01,219
In ninth grade. We had drama.

930
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,679
Actually, it might have been math.

931
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:04,055
I just remember there
being a lot of drama.

932
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,140
Hey!

933
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:07,142
He was a snot-nosed little brat.
He just followed me around.

934
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:09,936
He had snot in his
nose? But he's famous.

935
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:12,522
Hey! I'm talking to you, Scott Pilgrim.

936
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:14,357
He's famous and he talked to me.

937
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,401
The only thing keeping me and her apart

938
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:19,195
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

939
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:25,201
Can I have your... Can I
have your autograph, please?

940
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:26,327
What's up?

941
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,957
How's life? He seems nice.

942
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,586
Boom!

943
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:39,841
/And that's a cut!

944
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:43,428
Scott, evil ex. Fight.

945
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:46,181
/Let's get ready to go again,
/please. Let's get ready to go again.

946
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:48,808
/Hey, hombre.

947
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:55,440
You really think you can stand a
chance against an A-lister, bro?

948
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:59,486
Some competish you are.

949
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:01,404
Hey!

950
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:03,740
Hey!

951
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:05,742
Hey, I'm not done with you.

952
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,078
Oh!

953
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:13,166
Looks like you're seeing double.

954
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,501
He's good, right?

955
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,586
Sometimes I let him do the wide shots

956
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:23,635
when I feel like getting
blazed back in my Winnie.

957
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:27,806
What can I say?

958
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:33,228
I'm nothing without my stunt team.

959
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,733
Hey! Ask them how it feels to
always get his sloppy seconds.

960
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:42,195
How does it...

961
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:16,187
Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You homies want anything?

962
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:20,734
No, I just ate. Negative.

963
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,991
That's actually hilarious.

964
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,159
Ah.

965
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,828
Hilarious.

966
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,664
Mr. Lee!

967
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:42,797
You're needed back on set.

968
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,908
Prepare...

969
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:14,162
Prepare to feel the wrath
of the League of Evil Exes.

970
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,373
The League of Evil Axes?

971
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,042
You really don't know about the League?

972
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:22,629
The seven evil exes? Coming to kill you?

973
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,548
Controlling the future
of Ramona's love life?

974
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,800
No.

975
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:28,885
Oh, well, hey, listen,
man. Don't worry about it.

976
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,512
Really? Yeah. Let's go get a beer.

977
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:31,554
That's great...

978
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:34,099
Boom!

979
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,269
You are a pretty good actor.

980
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:40,897
I'm going for the Oscar this year.

981
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:42,899
But are you a pretty good skater?

982
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,318
/I'm more than pretty good, ese.

983
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,737
I have my own skate company.

984
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:53,493
But can you do a thingy on that rail?

985
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:56,079
It's called a grind, bro.

986
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:01,543
So, can you do a grindy thingy now?

987
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:05,171
Are you serious?

988
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,258
There are, like, 200 steps,
and the rails are garbage.

989
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:11,011
Well, hey, if it's too hardcore then...

990
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:14,472
You really think you can goad me
into doing a trick like that?

991
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:18,727
There are girls watching.

992
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:22,230
Somebody get me my board.

993
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:25,483
Hi. Big fan.

994
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:29,988
Why wouldnâ€™t you be?

995
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,086
Wow.

996
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:48,965
Wow.

997
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,302
Wow.

998
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:58,308
Wow.

999
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,061
Yes! He totally bailed.

1000
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:02,479
Ah! I didn't get his autograph.

1001
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,605
No.

1002
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:05,940
/And that's a wrap, everybody.

1003
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:08,860
Hey, where's Ramona. Is she still here?

1004
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:11,237
No. She totally bailed.

1005
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,823
What's the deal? Seriously.

1006
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:17,494
/Let's move, people,
/the sun is coming up.

1007
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:22,082
Hey, it's me again. Scott. Give
me a call when you get this.

1008
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:24,876
Scott Pilgrim.

1009
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:27,379
What's the deal? Seriously.

1010
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,714
Yep. You said that last night.

1011
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:31,466
You know what really sucks, though?

1012
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,259
What?

1013
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:34,761
Everything.

1014
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,763
Come on, guy.

1015
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,682
You can't say you
didn't see this coming.

1016
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:41,226
What?

1017
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:43,812
What did you think these were?

1018
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:46,856
Kisses? Seven little kisses?

1019
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:50,610
Seven deadly X's.

1020
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:56,950
Why does everything have
to be so complicated?

1021
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:59,536
If you want something bad,
you have to fight for it.

1022
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,162
Step up your game, Scott.

1023
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:02,539
Break out the L-word.

1024
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,040
"Lesbian?"

1025
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:06,167
The other L-word.

1026
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:07,585
"Lesbians?"

1027
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,338
It's "love," Scott. I
wasn't trying to trick you.

1028
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,882
Hey, buddy, look,

1029
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:16,011
if she really is the
girl of your dreams,

1030
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:17,554
then you have to let her know.

1031
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:21,516
You have to overcome any and all
obstacles that lie in your path.

1032
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:25,437
You can do it. Be with
her! It's your destiny!

1033
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:27,480
Plus, I need you to move out.

1034
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:28,648
What? Yeah.

1035
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,066
I'm kind of banking on
her calling you back

1036
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,570
so I don't have to evict you
and feel all guilty and shit.

1037
00:52:33,611 --> 00:52:36,531
I have a feeling that's for you, guy.

1038
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:37,615
Hey.

1039
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:38,742
/Hey, Scott.

1040
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,244
Envy? Oh, shit.

1041
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:42,412
Been a while.

1042
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:43,496
Yeah.

1043
00:52:43,538 --> 00:52:44,748
A year, I think.

1044
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:46,332
Approximately.

1045
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:47,500
How are you?

1046
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:49,294
I'm not doing so good right now.

1047
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:53,465
Oh, that's too bad.
Still breaking hearts?

1048
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:57,594
What? No. I've been... It's been
different. You have no idea.

1049
00:52:57,635 --> 00:53:00,221
/Probably not. Do you have a girlfriend?

1050
00:53:00,263 --> 00:53:02,307
/Should I be jealous?

1051
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,642
Yes, you should. I have this
totally awesome girlfriend

1052
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:07,270
who calls me all the
time and she's America.

1053
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:08,396
She's American.

1054
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:09,606
What's her name?

1055
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:11,441
I'm not telling you that. Ramona.

1056
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:12,776
Oh.

1057
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:13,860
What? Do you know her?

1058
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,737
What? No.

1059
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:17,238
It sounded like you did.

1060
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,866
I got to go. It's been
nice chatting with you.

1061
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:22,410
Wait.

1062
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:29,334
Okay.

1063
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,753
Everything does suck.

1064
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:35,215
Or does it? Hello?

1065
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:37,717
Hey, Knives.

1066
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:41,054
What's that? You're outside?

1067
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,597
Is Scott here?

1068
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,143
You know what? He just left.

1069
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:48,311
Really?

1070
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,855
Yeah.

1071
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:54,109
Sorry.

1072
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:57,070
/Do you have a girlfriend?

1073
00:53:57,112 --> 00:54:00,407
/Seven deadly X's.

1074
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:03,993
/You may have to defeat
/my seven evil exes.

1075
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:06,246
/It's sudden death now, okay?

1076
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:08,498
/She's got some battle scars, dude.

1077
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:13,420
/You can't say you
/didn't see this coming.

1078
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:15,964
Dude.

1079
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:19,718
Please.

1080
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:23,763
I'm really not in the mood for this.

1081
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:27,100
Okay, enough!

1082
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:34,858
You punched me in the boob!

1083
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:37,027
Prepare to die, obviously.

1084
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:39,362
Look, I've had it today. Can
we not do this right now?

1085
00:54:39,404 --> 00:54:41,531
I'd love to postpone, darling,

1086
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,200
but I just cashed my last rain check.

1087
00:54:44,242 --> 00:54:46,411
What's that from? My brain!

1088
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:49,205
I'm really, really not up
for this. Whatever it is.

1089
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:52,751
Okay, little chicken.
I'll see you later.

1090
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,544
But you won't see me,

1091
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:58,506
because next time, I'll be
deadly serious next time.

1092
00:54:58,548 --> 00:54:59,549
What?

1093
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:02,302
Never mind!

1094
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:05,722
Man. Someone help me.

1095
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,098
/Hello. It's Scott.

1096
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,391
What did he do this time?

1097
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:10,018
No, it's Scott. It's actually me.

1098
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,144
What did you do this time?

1099
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,896
I didn't do anything. It's
everyone else that's crazy.

1100
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:14,981
Look, I'm having a meltdown or
whatever. Are you still working?

1101
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:16,191
I'm literally about to leave.

1102
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:20,236
Cool, I'm coming in.

1103
00:55:23,865 --> 00:55:25,408
I think I'll make it a decaf today.

1104
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,160
Scott Pilgrim!

1105
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:29,621
What did you do with my sister?

1106
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:32,040
Sorry, I had to go.

1107
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,917
So, what can I .... get you?

1108
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:35,251
Is there anywhere you don't work?

1109
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:38,421
They're called jobs. Something a ....
like you wouldnâ€™t know anything about.

1110
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:40,757
And by the way, I can't ....
believe you asked Ramona out

1111
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,385
after I specifically told
you not to .... do that.

1112
00:55:43,426 --> 00:55:44,803
How are you doing that with your mouth?

1113
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,930
Never .... mind how I'm doing it!

1114
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:48,640
What do you have to say for yourself?

1115
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:51,101
Can I get a caramel macchiato?

1116
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:53,770
You know what, maybe it's high ....
time you took a look in a mirror

1117
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,522
before you wreak havoc on another girl.

1118
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:56,731
Me? Wreak havoc?

1119
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:57,982
And speaking of which,

1120
00:55:58,024 --> 00:55:59,234
I hear the girl that kicked
your heart in the ass

1121
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:02,195
is walking the streets of Toronto again.

1122
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:06,991
So, I can just get my coffee over here?

1123
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,827
Sorry that got a little
crazy last night.

1124
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:11,496
Yeah, you kind of disappeared.

1125
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:15,125
Yeah, I do that.

1126
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:19,295
Listen, I know I can be hard
to be around sometimes.

1127
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:21,548
I totally understand if you
don't want to hang out anymore.

1128
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:23,967
No, no, I want to hang.

1129
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,844
You know, the whole evil
ex-boyfriend thing...

1130
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:26,970
Exes.

1131
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:28,596
It's no biggie.

1132
00:56:28,638 --> 00:56:31,182
I know it's early,

1133
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:33,727
but I don't think anything
can get in the way of how I...

1134
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:36,187
Shit!

1135
00:56:36,229 --> 00:56:37,397
It's my ex.

1136
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,441
A big one? Mmm-hmm.

1137
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:41,985
Envy.

1138
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,989
I'm gonna...

1139
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,034
Excuse me.

1140
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:50,994
Your hair is getting shaggy.

1141
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:52,120
Yeah?

1142
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:53,747
So, that's Ramona.

1143
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:55,040
Yeah.

1144
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,541
Okay, I'm jealous.

1145
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,834
You're jealous?

1146
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,085
I'm allowed.

1147
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,338
You left me for that cocky pretty boy.

1148
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,256
You haven't even seen him.

1149
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:05,508
I know, you left me for
someone I've never even seen.

1150
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,428
Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.

1151
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,348
You should so totally come.

1152
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:13,933
That's so not going to happen.

1153
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:17,771
Great, you're so on the list.

1154
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:21,858
Caramel macchiato for .... Pilgrim.

1155
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,360
So, that was Envy.

1156
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:24,527
Uh-huh.

1157
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:26,029
What happened with the two of you?

1158
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:28,073
Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

1159
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:29,657
She wanted to move to Montreal,

1160
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:31,534
because she missed her best friend.

1161
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:33,036
This guy, Todd.

1162
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,080
And two weeks later, they were
sleeping together, I guess?

1163
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:36,748
Basically.

1164
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,001
Dated a Todd once.
Didn't end well, either.

1165
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:44,089
I can see how it sucks. Having
the past come back to haunt you.

1166
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,591
Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?

1167
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,426
What do you want to think about?

1168
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:50,595
How warm my place is right now.

1169
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,931
Oh.

1170
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:56,059
And you didn't bang her? Are you gay?

1171
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:58,687
I couldnâ€™t stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

1172
00:57:58,728 --> 00:58:00,230
Is that the Uma Thurman movie?

1173
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:04,609
Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.

1174
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:06,736
Double negative. It's tricky.

1175
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:08,738
It's over. Move on.

1176
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,781
Word.

1177
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:12,784
Right. I'm not going to
let her toy with me.

1178
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,911
From this moment on,

1179
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:19,082
I will think of Envy Adams no more!

1180
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:20,375
I have distressing news.

1181
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:23,420
Is it news that we suck, because I
really don't think I can take it.

1182
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:26,506
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

1183
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:28,675
and Envy asked us to open for them.

1184
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:29,801
I hate you.

1185
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,053
A gig is a gig, is a gig, is a gig.

1186
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,513
Maybe you can put your history aside

1187
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,682
until we get through this
thing, for the band.

1188
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,475
For the band? For the band?

1189
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:38,935
Can't we do our... For the band?

1190
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:40,145
Can't we do our own secret shows?

1191
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:42,105
All our shows are secret shows.

1192
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:45,150
We're doing it. G- Man might be there.

1193
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:47,110
We play the next round of
the battle on Tuesday.

1194
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,572
We have to get some buzz
going. We need groundswell.

1195
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:54,325
We need stalkers.

1196
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:01,082
What would you do if
your ex was in a band

1197
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:02,959
and they wanted you to open for them?

1198
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,753
If my ex was in a band?

1199
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:06,338
Mmm-hmm.

1200
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:07,922
Might be a little awkward, but maybe

1201
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:09,883
it's the grown-up thing to do.

1202
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:14,137
Yeah. We're all adults here, right?

1203
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,139
/Oh, my God!

1204
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:17,974
He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick!

1205
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,851
I hate her stupid guts!

1206
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:25,148
He only likes her because she's
old. She's probably, like, 25!

1207
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,567
She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?

1208
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,569
I think you mentioned she was fat.

1209
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:30,987
She's got a head start.

1210
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:34,449
I mean, I didn't even know there
was good music until two months ago!

1211
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:35,575
Hey, this really burns.

1212
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:37,827
You should rinse.

1213
00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:40,413
When I got this idea, I just
thought, "I have to do it!"

1214
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,041
I can't hear anything you're saying.

1215
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,878
Oh, God! I look so

1216
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:49,130
good.

1217
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:51,841
Ramona Flowers stole my Scott.

1218
00:59:51,883 --> 00:59:55,136
But I know how to get him back.

1219
00:59:55,178 --> 00:59:57,597
How?

1220
01:00:07,857 --> 01:00:11,569
/Come on, come on

1221
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:16,908
/Thank you, we were Sex Bob-Omb.

1222
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,451
Yeah!

1223
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:22,038
/We have some merch at the back, so...

1224
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,583
Okay, bar? Now?

1225
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,714
Level with me. Did we suck?

1226
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:34,634
I don't know. Did you?

1227
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:39,973
She has to go. She knows we suck.

1228
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:44,853
Hey, Ramona.

1229
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,439
Hey.

1230
01:00:47,605 --> 01:00:51,026
What the hell?

1231
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,576
Hey.

1232
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:01,036
Hey, Scott.

1233
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:03,246
What the hell?

1234
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:05,623
Look who Knives is hanging out with.

1235
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:06,875
Who is that girl again?

1236
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:07,917
Scott dated her.

1237
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:09,461
Briefly, briefly.

1238
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:13,006
How old is she?

1239
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:16,509
I gotta pee on her.

1240
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:20,889
I mean, I gotta pee. Pee time.

1241
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,392
/And then it was time

1242
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:28,146
/for Toronto to drown
/in the sweet sorrow

1243
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:32,901
/of The Clash at Demonhead!

1244
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:39,282
Envy! Envy!

1245
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,285
That guy on bass...

1246
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:43,620
/Oh, yeah

1247
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:45,038
...that's Todd.

1248
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,206
I know.

1249
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,708
/Oh, yeah?

1250
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,959
You know?

1251
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:52,837
/Oh, yeah!

1252
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,798
Oh, no.

1253
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:58,635
/Hello, again, friend of a friend

1254
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:02,263
/I knew you well

1255
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,474
/Our common goal

1256
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:09,813
/was waiting for the world to end

1257
01:02:10,313 --> 01:02:12,273
/Now that the truth

1258
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:17,404
/is just a rule that you demand

1259
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:19,864
/You crack the whip

1260
01:02:19,906 --> 01:02:24,202
/Shape-shift and trick the past again

1261
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:28,581
/Send you my love on the wire

1262
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:32,002
/Lift you up, every time

1263
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:34,963
/Everyone

1264
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:39,009
/pulls away

1265
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:42,303
/from you

1266
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:45,432
That was... That was devastating.

1267
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:47,475
Oh, my God. Just, oh, my God.

1268
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:50,562
Yeah, you should see them
live. They're much better live.

1269
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:54,190
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1270
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:55,817
I can't even believe I'm saying this,

1271
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,653
but Envy Adams would like
you all to come backstage.

1272
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:00,155
All of us?

1273
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:04,117
Did I .... stutter?

1274
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:07,412
Wait, how do you know Envy?

1275
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:11,041
Scott dated her.

1276
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:15,712
Hey, Ramona.

1277
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,422
Hey, Todd.

1278
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,466
It's been awhile.

1279
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:20,967
Mmm-hmm.

1280
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:22,802
Mmm-hmm?

1281
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:24,179
I think we should get out of here.

1282
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,222
So, how was the tour? You
guys play with the Pixies?

1283
01:03:26,264 --> 01:03:27,807
You're like a superstar now.

1284
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:30,560
Yeah, it's not really
something I can put into words.

1285
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,854
Um, Envy...

1286
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:34,689
I read your blog.

1287
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:37,734
So, Scott and Ramona, eh?

1288
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:38,902
What of it?

1289
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:41,279
You guys make a cute couple, you know?

1290
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:42,489
Suit each other.

1291
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,824
You're my role model, Envy.

1292
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:47,118
Ramona, I like your outfit. Affordable?

1293
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,204
Envy, I was just gonna say did
you get those jeans in New York?

1294
01:03:49,245 --> 01:03:51,873
I'm talking to Ramona right now.

1295
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,041
Ramona lived in New York.

1296
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:54,250
Did she?

1297
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:58,046
I was just there. Played the
Chaos Theatre, for Gideon.

1298
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:00,507
You know him, right?

1299
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:06,262
I've kissed the lips that kissed you!

1300
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,099
Knives!

1301
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,266
What?

1302
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:13,395
I'm not afraid to hit a girl.

1303
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:15,021
I'm a rock star.

1304
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:17,232
Oh, my God!

1305
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:21,277
You punched the highlights
out of her hair.

1306
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:24,072
He punched the highlights
out of her hair!

1307
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,116
You are incorrigible.

1308
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:30,078
I don't know the meaning of the word.

1309
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:35,375
So, you guys doing anything
fun while you're in town?

1310
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,378
Fun? In Toronto?

1311
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,548
That's it! You cocky cock!

1312
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:47,971
You'll pay for your
crimes against humanity.

1313
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:58,523
My neck.

1314
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,817
Your hair.

1315
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,402
Didn't you know?

1316
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:05,739
Todd's vegan.

1317
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,953
Vegan?

1318
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:15,498
It's not really that big of a deal.

1319
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,626
No kidding.

1320
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:21,171
Anyone can be vegan.

1321
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:23,465
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

1322
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:25,175
Ovo-what?

1323
01:05:25,216 --> 01:05:29,471
I partake not in the meat, nor
the breast milk, nor the ovum

1324
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:31,639
of any creature with a face.

1325
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:32,891
Short answer,

1326
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:35,477
being vegan just makes you
better than most people.

1327
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:38,104
Bingo.

1328
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:41,858
Hey, man, question.

1329
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,402
I always wondered, how does
not eating dairy products

1330
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:46,321
give you psychic powers?

1331
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:47,864
Okay.

1332
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:50,367
You know how you only
use 10% of your brain?

1333
01:05:50,408 --> 01:05:52,702
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

1334
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,913
Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

1335
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:56,414
Go ahead and get snippy, baby.

1336
01:05:56,456 --> 01:06:03,713
If you knew the science, maybe I'd
listen to a word you're saying.

1337
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,549
If I peed my pants, would you
pretend I just got wet from the rain?

1338
01:06:06,591 --> 01:06:07,676
It's not raining.

1339
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:08,927
Oh.

1340
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:10,637
Then why don't you give
me the Cliff Notes

1341
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:13,348
on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.

1342
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,724
Is that really important right now?

1343
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,768
Well, if there's a key
element in his backstory

1344
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:21,898
that's gonna help me out in a
critical moment of not dying, yes.

1345
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,819
I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.

1346
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,198
/Guess that's not very nice, but
/I used to be, kind of like that.

1347
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,618
/We hated everyone. We
/wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.

1348
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,870
/He punched a hole in the moon for me.

1349
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:37,789
/It was pretty crazy.

1350
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,082
/A week and a half later he told me

1351
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:41,584
/his dad was sending
/him to Vegan Academy,

1352
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:43,586
/so I dumped him.

1353
01:06:43,628 --> 01:06:45,922
Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?

1354
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:47,841
You've never been the dumpee?

1355
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:51,052
Look, I've dabbled in being a bitch.

1356
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,929
It's part of the reason I moved here.

1357
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:56,266
I was really hoping to just
leave it all behind me.

1358
01:06:56,307 --> 01:06:58,685
Hey, lovebirds...

1359
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:01,604
We have unfinished business, I and he.

1360
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:02,939
He and me.

1361
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,524
Don't you talk to me about grammar.

1362
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:06,484
/I dislike you, capisce?

1363
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:08,278
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

1364
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,446
What?

1365
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:11,656
Because you'll be dust by Monday.

1366
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:12,782
Um...

1367
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:14,909
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

1368
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:18,788
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

1369
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,833
She dusts.

1370
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:24,961
So, what's on Monday?

1371
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:29,674
Because it's Friday now. She
has the weekends off, so...

1372
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,302
Monday. Right?

1373
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:33,720
Basically, you can't win this fight.

1374
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:34,971
You're gonna have to give up this girl,

1375
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,182
because Todd's gonna kill you.

1376
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:41,519
You used to be so nice!

1377
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:53,948
Scott, we're gonna go to
Pizza Pizza for a slice.

1378
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,450
Call us when you're done.

1379
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:59,996
He'll be done. Real soon.

1380
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:07,379
Sounds like someone wants to get funky.

1381
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:32,422
I can read your thoughts. Your
will is broken. You're through.

1382
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:34,424
What say we drink to my memory?

1383
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,926
Fair trade blend with soy milk?

1384
01:09:36,968 --> 01:09:38,928
I'm sorry, but that's pathetic.

1385
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,014
Dude, I can see in your mind's eye.

1386
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:43,224
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1387
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:45,518
in an attempt to make
me break vegan edge.

1388
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,148
I'll take the one with soy.

1389
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,318
Thanks, tool.

1390
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,613
/Actually, muchacho, I
/poured the soy in this cup.

1391
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:59,532
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

1392
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:03,495
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.

1393
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:05,080
What are you talking about?

1394
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:08,333
You just drank half-and-half, baby.

1395
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,709
Freeze! Vegan police!

1396
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:10,960
Vegan police!

1397
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:14,589
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

1398
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:18,385
code number 827, imbibement
of half-and-half.

1399
01:10:18,426 --> 01:10:19,552
That's bullroar!

1400
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:21,554
No vegan diet, no vegan powers!

1401
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:23,807
But it's only my first offense.

1402
01:10:23,848 --> 01:10:25,016
Don't I get three strikes? I mean...

1403
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:27,310
Take it.

1404
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:29,979
At 12:27 a. m. on February 1st,

1405
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:32,148
you knowingly ingested gelato.

1406
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,358
Gelato isn't vegan?

1407
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,859
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

1408
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:39,656
On April 4th, 7:30 p. m., you
partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

1409
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:41,533
Chicken isn't vegan?

1410
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:46,663
The de-veganizing ray. Hit him.

1411
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:01,219
Oh, my God!

1412
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,972
No. No.

1413
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:07,308
You once were a vegone,

1414
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,686
but now you will be gone.

1415
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:12,439
Vegone?

1416
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:28,913
Yeah! Yeah!

1417
01:11:33,918 --> 01:11:37,088
Sorry, I guess.

1418
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,174
Sorry?

1419
01:11:39,215 --> 01:11:43,511
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

1420
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:48,558
You kicked my heart in the
ass, so I guess we're even.

1421
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,019
Natalie.

1422
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:56,858
Natalie? No one calls me that anymore.

1423
01:11:56,983 --> 01:12:00,779
Maybe they should.

1424
01:12:01,112 --> 01:12:05,325
Let's get out of here.

1425
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:13,333
For the record, I am so pissed
off for you, right now.

1426
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,251
Shut the .... up, Julie.

1427
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:17,712
Okay.

1428
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,464
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

1429
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,341
I'm not sure there's going
to be much of a party.

1430
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:23,093
I think a third of the
band just went "poom. "

1431
01:12:23,134 --> 01:12:25,804
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

1432
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:28,640
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.

1433
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,684
Then why would we... Oh.

1434
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:32,852
Neil, you down?

1435
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:35,146
Scott, you're in, right?

1436
01:12:35,188 --> 01:12:36,356
You wanna go?

1437
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:39,734
Well, I kind of almost died back there.

1438
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:40,944
I'm not saying I want to go.

1439
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,070
Yeah. We can totally go.

1440
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:43,154
I'll do whatever you want to do.

1441
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:45,407
So, let's go.

1442
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:47,200
We really don't have
to go to this thing.

1443
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:49,077
It'll probably be a
bad scene all around.

1444
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:51,663
No, I'm fine. It's just...

1445
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,332
It's just... Well...

1446
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:57,460
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1447
01:12:57,502 --> 01:12:59,295
So far, you're not a total ass.

1448
01:12:59,337 --> 01:13:00,547
But I'm part ass?

1449
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:02,757
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

1450
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:03,842
Wait, is that good?

1451
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:05,093
It's what I need right now.

1452
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,177
But not later?

1453
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:08,096
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

1454
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:10,890
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

1455
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:12,934
I'd just like to live.

1456
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,477
Look, I know Todd was bad news,

1457
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:15,979
but are you saying Envy wasn't?

1458
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:17,397
We all have baggage.

1459
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,525
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

1460
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,485
What did you do to make your
ex-boyfriend so insane?

1461
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:23,862
Exes. Whatever.

1462
01:13:23,903 --> 01:13:26,114
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

1463
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:28,742
What about you and that girl,
Knives? Who broke up with who?

1464
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:31,411
I believe I broke up with her.

1465
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:32,787
And was she cool with that?

1466
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,331
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

1467
01:13:35,373 --> 01:13:36,416
You sure about that?

1468
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,043
Yeah, she's very mature for her age.

1469
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:39,377
We had a very healthy breakup.

1470
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,712
We're all peaches and gravy.

1471
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:42,130
No!

1472
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,673
What about you and Kim?

1473
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:45,925
Me and Kim? I can barely remember.

1474
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:48,136
It was high school. She had freckles.

1475
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,262
That's it?

1476
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:52,349
Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.

1477
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,516
That's really the whole story?

1478
01:13:53,558 --> 01:13:55,477
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

1479
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:58,188
I fought a crazy, 80-foot-tall,
purple-suited dude

1480
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:00,357
and I had to fight 96
guys to get to him.

1481
01:14:00,398 --> 01:14:03,068
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

1482
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,570
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

1483
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:08,073
Does that make you feel any better?

1484
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:11,701
Well, now you are being a
total ass. Welcome to the club.

1485
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:13,995
I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.

1486
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:18,416
Hey, don't worry. I don't even
know what I'm like anymore.

1487
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:21,294
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

1488
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:26,716
Exes. Why do you keep saying that?

1489
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:32,555
/The girl from earlier?

1490
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,557
Roxy? You know this girl?

1491
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:37,769
Boy, does she know me.

1492
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:40,188
What is she talking about?

1493
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:43,191
He really doesn't know?

1494
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,110
Wait.

1495
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:47,570
Hmm?

1496
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,074
You and her? It was just a phase.

1497
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:52,784
Just a phase? You had a sexy phase?

1498
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:54,369
It meant nothing. I didn't
think it would count.

1499
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:55,495
It meant nothing?

1500
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:56,788
I was just a little bi-curious.

1501
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,415
Well, honey,

1502
01:14:58,456 --> 01:15:02,836
I'm a little bi-furious.

1503
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:15,140
Do that again and I will end you.

1504
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:17,100
Back off, hasbian.

1505
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:21,312
If Gideon can't have you, no one can.

1506
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:24,274
The League has spoken.

1507
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:26,609
Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here

1508
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:34,743
because I'm about to kick yours
out of the Great White North.

1509
01:15:43,668 --> 01:15:45,587
Wallace? Uh-huh?

1510
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,380
This is happening, right? Oh, yeah.

1511
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:51,634
Kick her in the balls.

1512
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:12,864
I'm sending you back to Gideon

1513
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:16,993
in a thousand pieces, you slag!

1514
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:19,329
Ha!

1515
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,335
I'd rather be dead than go back.

1516
01:16:25,377 --> 01:16:26,753
He's a creep, you're a bitch,

1517
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:28,004
and you all deserve each other.

1518
01:16:28,046 --> 01:16:30,256
Give it a rest, Ramona.
This is a League game.

1519
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:31,424
Meaning?

1520
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:37,180
Meaning your precious Scott must
defeat me with his own fists.

1521
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:40,475
I don't think I can hit
a girl. They're soft.

1522
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:44,896
You don't have a choice.

1523
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:06,292
Fight your own battles, lazy ass!

1524
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:12,424
Lazy ass!

1525
01:17:17,595 --> 01:17:20,265
Every Pilgrim reaches
the end of his journey.

1526
01:17:20,306 --> 01:17:24,227
Some sooner than others.

1527
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:29,065
Your BF's about to get F'd in the B.

1528
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:31,776
Her weak point is the back of her knees.

1529
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:33,695
Wait, how does that work?

1530
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:36,239
Whenever we were making
out I would just...

1531
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:39,576
Okay, enough.

1532
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:52,005
You'll never be able to do this to her.

1533
01:18:05,643 --> 01:18:06,853
So...

1534
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,355
Two gin-and-tonics, please?

1535
01:18:08,396 --> 01:18:09,606
I thought you didn't drink.

1536
01:18:09,647 --> 01:18:13,109
Only on special occasions.
Why? Did you want one?

1537
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:15,570
Guess we really don't know that
much about each other, do we?

1538
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:18,615
Maybe you could just give me
a list of all of your exes

1539
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:20,325
so that I can at least
know who's going to

1540
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:21,993
beat my ass into the ground next.

1541
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:24,746
Like a handy little laminate or
something? Let me see if I have one.

1542
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:26,289
Maybe we could exchange our information.

1543
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,750
Hey, just out of sheer
curiosity and concern

1544
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:30,085
for my mortal well-being,

1545
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:37,842
is there anyone at this party
that you haven't slept with?

1546
01:18:37,884 --> 01:18:39,636
I think we should split.

1547
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:42,138
As in get out of here,
or as in split, split?

1548
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,682
I'd hope you could figure that out.

1549
01:18:43,723 --> 01:18:45,725
Or did you miss the part
where I saved your ass?

1550
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,520
How could I? I feel like we just
washed our sexy laundry in public.

1551
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:50,105
Dirty laundry. You're drunk.

1552
01:18:50,146 --> 01:18:51,189
I had, like, one drink.

1553
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:54,984
I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all
this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it.

1554
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:56,152
I thought you might be
more understanding.

1555
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:57,320
I just...

1556
01:18:57,362 --> 01:19:02,534
You're just another evil
ex waiting to happen.

1557
01:19:02,575 --> 01:19:05,829
That was harsh.

1558
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:09,374
That was not good.

1559
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,168
That was embarrassing.

1560
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:13,461
One more.

1561
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:17,132
P.S. Here's your stupid list.

1562
01:19:17,173 --> 01:19:20,176
Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter.

1563
01:19:20,218 --> 01:19:22,971
Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?

1564
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:25,306
Oh!

1565
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,975
You don't know?

1566
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:28,184
The Katayanagi Twins

1567
01:19:28,226 --> 01:19:31,187
just happen to be the
next band in the battle.

1568
01:19:31,229 --> 01:19:34,482
They are totally bad-ass.

1569
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:36,526
Ramona dated twins? Apparently.

1570
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:37,694
At the same time?

1571
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:38,778
You know what?

1572
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,196
I don't know and I don't want to know.

1573
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:43,033
Good. Because you know how I feel
about girls blocking the rock.

1574
01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:44,701
Good, I play better
when I'm in a bad mood.

1575
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:45,910
If it's gonna be an issue though,

1576
01:19:45,952 --> 01:19:47,037
Young Neil can fill in for you.

1577
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:48,455
It's not an issue. You know bands,

1578
01:19:48,496 --> 01:19:50,081
I know battles. We got it covered.

1579
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:51,958
But we'd understand if you
didn't want to take part.

1580
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,335
Not only do I want to take part

1581
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:55,545
I want to take them apart.

1582
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,672
Okay, I'm getting tingles.

1583
01:19:57,714 --> 01:20:00,216
Whoa!

1584
01:20:00,508 --> 01:20:02,385
Okay, we're doomed. Oh!

1585
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:05,263
That poster needs more
exclamation marks.

1586
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:06,806
Oh, man, we're gonna get killed.

1587
01:20:06,848 --> 01:20:08,892
Come on, we're going on in five minutes.

1588
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:10,935
Wait, aren't the
Katayanagis going on first?

1589
01:20:10,977 --> 01:20:13,688
I think you're both on first.

1590
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,066
Wait, "Amp versus amp"?

1591
01:20:16,107 --> 01:20:17,776
We're going on stage at the same time?

1592
01:20:17,817 --> 01:20:20,612
That's impossible.

1593
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:21,946
Okay, my bad.

1594
01:20:21,988 --> 01:20:24,407
Your bad is saying, "My bad. "

1595
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:28,078
We shouldn't even be here.
We shouldn't even be here!

1596
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:30,497
Come on, man! I put my
problems aside for the music.

1597
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:31,915
If I can do that, we can do anything.

1598
01:20:31,956 --> 01:20:33,541
Did you speak to Ramona, then?

1599
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,503
What? No. I haven't seen
her since the other night.

1600
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:37,587
Oh.

1601
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:41,549
She's totally here.

1602
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:43,927
Scott?

1603
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:45,387
Not that I care,

1604
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:48,014
but you should go talk to
her before she's gone.

1605
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:49,099
Thanks, Kim.

1606
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,102
And I really don't care.

1607
01:20:52,143 --> 01:20:53,645
I didn't mean to put
you through all that.

1608
01:20:53,687 --> 01:21:00,485
I only did it because I
love you. You know that.

1609
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:36,104
Okay, gang, can we do this?

1610
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,397
I mean, we can do this, right?

1611
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:38,565
Right.

1612
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:41,192
Scott?

1613
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:44,362
Scott!

1614
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:04,883
They tore the roof off!

1615
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:07,761
/We are Sex Bob-Omb

1616
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:13,391
/and we're here to make you think
/about death and get sad and stuff!

1617
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:16,394
/This is the beginning of the song.

1618
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:19,189
/I'm hearing voices, animal noises

1619
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,607
/The crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me

1620
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:22,192
/The feminine abyss

1621
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:27,781
/And reaching my threshold Staring
/at the truth 'til I'm blind

1622
01:22:27,822 --> 01:22:29,282
/My body's stupid

1623
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:30,700
/Stereo putrid

1624
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,327
/Spilling out music

1625
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:33,745
/Into raw sewage

1626
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:41,670
/Reaching my threshold Staring
/at the truth 'til I'm blind

1627
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:45,674
/My threshold

1628
01:22:48,134 --> 01:22:50,804
/Reaching

1629
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:54,140
/My threshold

1630
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:07,862
Let's just break up now
and get it over with.

1631
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:11,449
We screwed the pooch in front
of Gideon Graves. We're done!

1632
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:13,451
Gideon's here? Where?

1633
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:17,747
That geeky guy next to your girlfriend.

1634
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:19,374
That's Gideon?

1635
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,002
Gideon is G-Man?

1636
01:23:22,043 --> 01:23:26,381
All right, let's do this.

1637
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:28,925
/Reaching my threshold

1638
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:32,262
/My threshold

1639
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,483
We're out.

1640
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:30,612
What are you doing?

1641
01:24:30,653 --> 01:24:34,157
Getting a life.

1642
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:50,423
I just came to see your show.

1643
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:54,260
I have to...

1644
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,519
Ramona.

1645
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,480
Ramona, I need to tell you something.

1646
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:06,856
Yeah, I have something
I have to tell you, too.

1647
01:25:06,898 --> 01:25:08,983
Great. Listen, I know you
play mysterious and aloof

1648
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:10,485
just to avoid getting hurt.

1649
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:14,656
I know you have reasons for not
wanting to talk about your past.

1650
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:18,368
I want you to know I don't
care about any of that stuff

1651
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:20,745
because I'm in lesbians with you.

1652
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:21,871
What?

1653
01:25:21,913 --> 01:25:25,625
I really, really mean it.

1654
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,293
Oh! Okay.

1655
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:30,630
It's your turn. What
did you want to tell me?

1656
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:33,258
That we have to break up.

1657
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:34,509
What?

1658
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:36,845
It's Gideon.

1659
01:25:36,886 --> 01:25:40,390
I just can't...

1660
01:25:40,932 --> 01:25:42,392
I can't help myself around him.

1661
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:45,061
That's the bad news.

1662
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:46,396
Hey.

1663
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:49,858
The good news is that I'm
officially loving the Sex-Bombs.

1664
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:51,526
Bob-Omb. Three-piece rock outfit

1665
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,987
with a smoking hot red-head on drums.

1666
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:56,948
Music to my ear-holes.

1667
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,950
You know what? I'm
not even going to wait

1668
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,493
to see how you guys do in the final.

1669
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:03,580
I'm signing you right now
for a three-album contract.

1670
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:07,167
See? I'm not such a bad guy after all.

1671
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,919
You think we're going to sell our
souls to you? Well, guess again.

1672
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:13,757
No, I can't be a part of the
band with this douche in charge.

1673
01:26:13,798 --> 01:26:15,925
Ow! Scott.

1674
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:18,678
You got to try and keep your
emotions in check, man.

1675
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,431
Don't let what's past ruin your future.

1676
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:23,099
The people need to hear us, Scott.

1677
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:27,520
Then you're gonna have to find
someone else to play bass.

1678
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:29,564
Whoops.

1679
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:33,735
Sign, sign, sign, and we are all set.

1680
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:37,572
Sweetie, shall we?

1681
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:45,121
Oh! Scott.

1682
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:47,457
You know, we really should
be thanking each other.

1683
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:50,210
I mean, if it wasn't for me, Ramona
would never have been with you

1684
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:52,295
but if it wasn't for you she
wouldnâ€™t have gotten back with me,

1685
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:55,632
so I guess it all shakes out.

1686
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:59,094
Scotty, buddy,

1687
01:26:59,844 --> 01:27:04,224
between you and I, the whole
League of Evil Exes thing?

1688
01:27:04,265 --> 01:27:08,478
I was in a really dark place
when I put that together, so...

1689
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,230
Forgiven?

1690
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:12,816
All right, let's go.

1691
01:27:12,857 --> 01:27:14,818
Yes!

1692
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:20,448
This is it, guys. We are on our way.

1693
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:25,537
I said "lesbians. "

1694
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:54,315
Scott.

1695
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,443
Was she really the one?

1696
01:27:56,484 --> 01:27:57,694
The what?

1697
01:27:57,736 --> 01:28:01,114
I mean, did you really see
a future with this girl?

1698
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:05,160
Like, with jetpacks.

1699
01:28:10,957 --> 01:28:13,543
Time heals all wounds, little brother.

1700
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:18,340
Maybe next time we don't date the
girl with 11 evil ex-boyfriends.

1701
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:19,507
Seven.

1702
01:28:19,549 --> 01:28:22,886
That's not that bad.

1703
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:24,804
Hey. Yeah, I know.

1704
01:28:24,846 --> 01:28:28,558
It's so pathetic!

1705
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:34,856
Turn off the light!

1706
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:37,901
Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk

1707
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:39,235
and I apologize for that.

1708
01:28:39,277 --> 01:28:40,320
Okay.

1709
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:42,113
And he apologizes, too.

1710
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:44,574
Sorry.

1711
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:48,161
Scott, you know I love you.

1712
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:50,705
But I'm gonna need my own bed tonight.

1713
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:52,916
It's for sex.

1714
01:28:52,957 --> 01:28:54,834
Right.

1715
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:58,213
I may need it for the
rest of the week, too.

1716
01:28:58,254 --> 01:28:59,506
Right.

1717
01:28:59,547 --> 01:29:01,257
And the year.

1718
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:02,592
I get it.

1719
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:05,762
Maybe you can move in with Ramona.

1720
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:07,097
She's with Gideon.

1721
01:29:07,138 --> 01:29:08,431
Oh, man.

1722
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:10,558
That's probably just because
he's better than you.

1723
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,726
Mmm.

1724
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:15,146
Either way, this fight is over.

1725
01:29:15,188 --> 01:29:17,982
Mmm-hmm.

1726
01:29:23,863 --> 01:29:26,408
It's for Scott.

1727
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:30,495
It's for you, big guy.

1728
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,579
Hello.

1729
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:33,206
/Hey, pal.

1730
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:35,792
/I just want to say I feel
/terrible about earlier.

1731
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,836
/I don't want any hard feelings.

1732
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:41,339
/So I figured, why not be the bigger
/man and just give you a call.

1733
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:43,633
Is Ramona with you?

1734
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:47,929
I don't know. Are you with me?

1735
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:50,473
Yeah.

1736
01:29:50,515 --> 01:29:53,476
Geez, buddy, it's gonna be all right.

1737
01:29:53,518 --> 01:29:56,062
No, I just spilled hot
cocoa on my crotch.

1738
01:29:56,104 --> 01:29:57,230
/Mmm-hmm.

1739
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:58,690
/Listen, as you know,

1740
01:29:58,732 --> 01:30:00,817
/I'm opening a new Chaos
/Theatre in Toronto.

1741
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:03,111
And the Sex-Bobs are playing
our grand opening tonight.

1742
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:06,031
It would feel really weird for
all of us if you weren't there.

1743
01:30:06,072 --> 01:30:09,909
They just did a sound check and
the acoustics in here are amazing!

1744
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:11,369
Yeah? Maybe I'll see you there.

1745
01:30:11,411 --> 01:30:13,038
/I hope so, amigo.

1746
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:15,540
I don't want any more
bad blood between exes.

1747
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:16,666
What do you say?

1748
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:17,792
Mmm.

1749
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:19,627
Okay, laters.

1750
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:23,673
What a perfect asshole.

1751
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:29,596
Forget what I said earlier. Finish him.

1752
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:52,243
Password?

1753
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:53,870
Whatever.

1754
01:30:53,912 --> 01:30:56,414
Cool.

1755
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:03,004
Second password?

1756
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:06,091
Cool.

1757
01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:11,388
/We're not having no fun
/We're not having no fun

1758
01:31:11,429 --> 01:31:14,891
No. The first album is much
better than the first album.

1759
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:17,352
/Fun

1760
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:20,397
/No fun

1761
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:28,446
Scott! Let it go.

1762
01:31:28,488 --> 01:31:30,073
Don't give him the satisfaction.

1763
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:32,283
What if I want the satisfaction?

1764
01:31:32,325 --> 01:31:35,370
Scott Pilgrim!

1765
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:38,039
Buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre.

1766
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:45,088
Somebody get this man a
drink. A Coke Zero, right?

1767
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:49,009
I'm not here to drink.

1768
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:51,970
Whoa, I've got no beef with you.

1769
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:55,056
What if I have a beef with you?

1770
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:58,184
Are you still mad about the
whole thing with The Guild?

1771
01:31:58,226 --> 01:31:59,436
You mean The League?

1772
01:31:59,477 --> 01:32:01,938
The Guild, League, whatever.
It's ancient history.

1773
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,648
I'll show you how
ancient of history it is!

1774
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,400
Wait, wait, wait!

1775
01:32:05,442 --> 01:32:08,153
There's no use crying
over spilt Coke, buddy.

1776
01:32:08,194 --> 01:32:12,866
The lady made her choice and we're
all just gonna have to move on.

1777
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:15,952
Well, I ain't moving, buddy.

1778
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:19,330
You wanna fight me for her?

1779
01:32:19,372 --> 01:32:23,293
Was that not clear?

1780
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:25,003
Was that not clear?

1781
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:26,171
I don't know.

1782
01:32:26,212 --> 01:32:31,760
Now, why on earth would
you want to do that?

1783
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:36,681
Because I'm in love with her.

1784
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:47,525
Aw! I think this deserves a song.

1785
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:49,152
Kimberly!

1786
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:51,154
/We are Sex Bob-Omb.

1787
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:54,532
/We are here to make money
/and sell out and stuff.

1788
01:32:54,574 --> 01:32:58,870
/One, two, three, four!

1789
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:54,801
Your club sucks, by the way.

1790
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:59,472
Well, if my cathedral of
cutting-edge taste holds no interest

1791
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:02,350
for your tragically
Canadian sensibilities,

1792
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:08,273
then I shall be forced to grant
you a swift exit from the premises.

1793
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:11,276
And a fast entrance into hell!

1794
01:34:11,317 --> 01:34:13,903
Scott!

1795
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:18,950
Knives?

1796
01:34:18,992 --> 01:34:20,326
That's priceless.

1797
01:34:20,368 --> 01:34:22,287
You'll pay for what you did to him.

1798
01:34:22,328 --> 01:34:24,372
Listen, Kung Pao Chicken,

1799
01:34:24,414 --> 01:34:27,292
your old, old boyfriend
brought this all on himself.

1800
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:30,128
He was warned plenty of
times, but did he listen? No.

1801
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:33,923
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her!

1802
01:34:33,965 --> 01:34:35,050
What?

1803
01:34:35,091 --> 01:34:36,843
You broke the heart that broke mine.

1804
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:41,181
Get ready to Chau down!

1805
01:34:44,434 --> 01:34:48,646
You're kidding, right?

1806
01:34:48,938 --> 01:34:50,065
Wow!

1807
01:34:50,106 --> 01:34:53,318
I mean, you can't say I don't
know how to put on a show, right?

1808
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,155
That's incredible.

1809
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:09,959
What the hell is your deal?

1810
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:12,879
You stole him!

1811
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:14,130
Stole him!

1812
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:15,965
I don't know what you're talking about.

1813
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:18,718
You liar! Liar!

1814
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,597
I didn't steal your boyfriend!
I didn't steal Scott!

1815
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,851
I didn't steal anyone!

1816
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:34,859
You steal my boyfriend!

1817
01:35:34,901 --> 01:35:36,152
Wait! Wait!

1818
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:39,155
Can we please stop all this
fighting? Nobody stole anybody.

1819
01:35:39,197 --> 01:35:45,704
Knives, I dated you and
then I dated Ramona, okay?

1820
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:49,374
Maybe I forgot to tell
Knives right away.

1821
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:52,544
You cheated on me, Scott?

1822
01:35:52,585 --> 01:35:54,671
You cheated on both of us?

1823
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:56,423
You cheated on me with Knives?

1824
01:35:56,464 --> 01:35:58,758
No,

1825
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:02,345
I cheated on Knives with you.

1826
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:04,180
Is there a difference?

1827
01:36:04,222 --> 01:36:06,891
You weren't wronged?

1828
01:36:06,933 --> 01:36:09,519
Right?

1829
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:12,564
Game over.

1830
01:36:16,985 --> 01:36:18,695
Scotty,

1831
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:22,073
you can cheat on these
ladies all you like.

1832
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:26,036
But you can't cheat

1833
01:36:26,244 --> 01:36:28,830
death.

1834
01:36:34,586 --> 01:36:36,379
Oh, man.

1835
01:36:36,421 --> 01:36:40,759
Sorry. Dying's got to suck.

1836
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,430
You know what sucks?
Getting killed by that guy.

1837
01:36:45,472 --> 01:36:47,057
Why him?

1838
01:36:47,098 --> 01:36:48,767
It's complicated.

1839
01:36:48,808 --> 01:36:52,228
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

1840
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:55,523
so now might be a good
time to get into it.

1841
01:36:55,565 --> 01:37:01,154
Truth is, it was me who was obsessed.

1842
01:37:01,196 --> 01:37:05,658
I was crazy about him.
But he ignored me.

1843
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:10,330
I was more alone when we were
together than I ever was on my own.

1844
01:37:10,372 --> 01:37:12,999
That's why I had to leave.

1845
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:16,419
And that's when he
started paying attention.

1846
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:18,088
So, why go back?

1847
01:37:18,129 --> 01:37:19,798
I can't help myself around him, Scott,

1848
01:37:19,839 --> 01:37:24,636
he just has this way of
getting into my head.

1849
01:37:24,678 --> 01:37:27,263
Well, that's legitimately disappointing.

1850
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:29,182
I really will leave
you alone forever now.

1851
01:37:29,224 --> 01:37:33,269
No, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.

1852
01:37:33,311 --> 01:37:36,606
That is evil.

1853
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:40,777
I didn't mean for you to get
dragged into this, Scott.

1854
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:44,572
I just wanted something simple.

1855
01:37:44,614 --> 01:37:47,325
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1856
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:49,452
Well, I really fought for you.

1857
01:37:49,494 --> 01:37:55,166
Maybe I'm not the one you
should have been fighting for.

1858
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:57,961
What? Wait.

1859
01:37:58,003 --> 01:38:03,466
But I feel like I learned something.

1860
01:38:03,508 --> 01:38:09,305
Which would be great if I wasn't dead.

1861
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:10,932
So alone.

1862
01:38:10,974 --> 01:38:14,769
/You're not alone.

1863
01:38:14,978 --> 01:38:17,564
Right!

1864
01:38:25,947 --> 01:38:29,492
Your hair looks stupid.

1865
01:38:29,534 --> 01:38:33,121
Second password?

1866
01:38:34,748 --> 01:38:35,874
Yeah, I saw it.

1867
01:38:35,915 --> 01:38:38,084
It's just the comic book
is better than the movie.

1868
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:40,378
/No fun

1869
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:41,963
Scott! Let it go.

1870
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:43,381
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

1871
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:44,591
Stephen, the new lineup rocks.

1872
01:38:44,632 --> 01:38:46,259
You guys sound way better without me.

1873
01:38:46,301 --> 01:38:48,011
Young Neil, you have learned well.

1874
01:38:48,053 --> 01:38:51,723
From this point forward you
will be known as "Neil. "

1875
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:53,767
And, Kim,

1876
01:38:53,808 --> 01:38:57,187
I'm sorry about everything.

1877
01:38:57,228 --> 01:39:00,023
I'm sorry about me.

1878
01:39:00,065 --> 01:39:02,275
Scott Pilgrim! Hey, buddy!

1879
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:05,820
Save it! You're pretentious!
This club sucks!

1880
01:39:05,862 --> 01:39:07,405
I've got beef. Let's do it.

1881
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:10,533
Wait, wait, wait!

1882
01:39:10,575 --> 01:39:14,412
You want to fight me for her?

1883
01:39:14,454 --> 01:39:16,206
No.

1884
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:20,960
I want to fight you for me.

1885
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,423
Um... Kim!

1886
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:28,009
We are Sex Bob-Omb and
we are here to watch

1887
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:30,512
Scott Pilgrim kick your teeth in!

1888
01:39:30,553 --> 01:39:34,766
One! Two! Three! Four!

1889
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:55,537
How's it going back there?

1890
01:39:55,578 --> 01:39:58,498
You dick!

1891
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:00,083
Knives?

1892
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:01,751
I know you're in here. Don't attack...

1893
01:40:01,793 --> 01:40:04,379
Scott!

1894
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:07,465
Steal my boyfriend!

1895
01:40:07,507 --> 01:40:09,801
Taste my steel!

1896
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:10,927
Enough!

1897
01:40:10,969 --> 01:40:12,429
No, Scott.

1898
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:15,098
This fat-ass hurt me and
I will have my revenge!

1899
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:20,603
No, Knives, I hurt
you. I cheated on you.

1900
01:40:20,645 --> 01:40:24,566
I cheated on both of you.

1901
01:40:24,607 --> 01:40:26,943
I'm really sorry.

1902
01:40:26,985 --> 01:40:28,987
And you're not a fat-ass.

1903
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:33,116
She didn't mean that.

1904
01:40:33,324 --> 01:40:37,328
So, are we all good?

1905
01:40:37,912 --> 01:40:39,414
Never felt better.

1906
01:40:39,456 --> 01:40:41,916
Yoo-hoo!

1907
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:45,754
Are we done with the
hugging and learning?

1908
01:40:45,795 --> 01:40:48,048
I thought we had a fight going on here!

1909
01:40:48,089 --> 01:40:51,217
You've got a fight, all right!

1910
01:40:51,259 --> 01:40:54,971
Wrong move, baby.

1911
01:41:08,735 --> 01:41:11,154
Hey.

1912
01:41:24,209 --> 01:41:28,922
You made me swallow my gum.

1913
01:41:29,464 --> 01:41:36,680
It's gonna be in my digestive
tract for seven years.

1914
01:42:16,428 --> 01:42:20,432
Yeah, still my girl.

1915
01:42:22,183 --> 01:42:26,187
Let's both be girls.

1916
01:42:28,648 --> 01:42:31,651
/Bad! Bad!

1917
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:44,080
What?

1918
01:42:44,122 --> 01:42:46,124
/Get ready!

1919
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:49,377
/Here we go!

1920
01:42:56,593 --> 01:42:59,346
/Good! Good! Good!

1921
01:42:59,387 --> 01:43:02,098
/Combo!

1922
01:43:04,976 --> 01:43:07,896
/Perfect!

1923
01:43:18,656 --> 01:43:21,826
Who do you think you are, Pilgrim?

1924
01:43:21,868 --> 01:43:25,163
You think you're better than me?

1925
01:43:25,205 --> 01:43:27,499
I'll tell you what you are.

1926
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:30,168
A pain in my ass!

1927
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:34,130
You know how long it took

1928
01:43:34,172 --> 01:43:36,800
to get all the evil
exes' contact information

1929
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:39,469
so I could form this stupid league?

1930
01:43:39,511 --> 01:43:44,224
Like, two hours! Two hours!

1931
01:43:45,684 --> 01:43:48,144
You're not cool enough for Ramona.

1932
01:43:48,186 --> 01:43:50,814
You're zero! You're nothing!

1933
01:43:50,855 --> 01:43:53,024
Me? I'm what's hip.

1934
01:43:53,066 --> 01:43:54,526
I'm what's happening!

1935
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:57,028
I'm blowing up right now!

1936
01:43:57,070 --> 01:43:59,197
You are blowing up.

1937
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:01,783
Right now!

1938
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:04,327
/K-O!

1939
01:44:13,378 --> 01:44:15,797
Wow!

1940
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:21,594
Yeah, wow.

1941
01:44:29,769 --> 01:44:31,271
There goes our deal!

1942
01:44:31,312 --> 01:44:33,523
We're still getting paid, right?

1943
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:36,151
There goes our deal.

1944
01:44:36,192 --> 01:44:39,404
Oh! Oh, God!

1945
01:44:49,372 --> 01:44:51,750
You two make a good combo.

1946
01:44:51,791 --> 01:44:53,877
Yeah?

1947
01:44:53,918 --> 01:44:55,003
Yeah.

1948
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:58,548
/Scott Pilgrim.

1949
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:04,512
/You can defeat me, Scott,

1950
01:45:04,554 --> 01:45:09,434
/but can you defeat yourself?

1951
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,482
Uh-oh!

1952
01:45:15,523 --> 01:45:16,775
Nega Scott.

1953
01:45:16,816 --> 01:45:20,028
/Nega Scott!

1954
01:45:22,447 --> 01:45:23,865
No.

1955
01:45:23,907 --> 01:45:28,995
This is something I have to face.

1956
01:45:29,037 --> 01:45:31,748
Myself.

1957
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:35,543
/Solo round!

1958
01:45:36,002 --> 01:45:39,506
They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it

1959
01:45:39,547 --> 01:45:40,799
and you get bacon on the side.

1960
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,008
I'm liking that.

1961
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,802
Let's do it next week. Yeah, Tuesday.

1962
01:45:43,843 --> 01:45:44,969
Yeah, all right. Be good.

1963
01:45:45,011 --> 01:45:46,429
Yeah, yeah.

1964
01:45:46,471 --> 01:45:48,848
Hey.

1965
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,392
What happened?

1966
01:45:50,433 --> 01:45:53,353
Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.

1967
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:55,230
We're gonna get brunch next week.

1968
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:57,023
We actually have a lot in common.

1969
01:45:57,065 --> 01:46:00,652
Your hair, it's getting really shaggy.

1970
01:46:00,694 --> 01:46:03,780
It is? Yeah.

1971
01:46:03,822 --> 01:46:06,866
You should probably get it cut.

1972
01:46:06,908 --> 01:46:08,618
Yeah, you're right.

1973
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,911
I should get it cut.

1974
01:46:09,953 --> 01:46:11,496
At a salon.

1975
01:46:11,538 --> 01:46:13,915
Salon, yeah. That sounds really nice.

1976
01:46:13,957 --> 01:46:16,376
Hey.

1977
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:18,378
You're going?

1978
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,797
I should probably disappear.

1979
01:46:20,839 --> 01:46:22,924
After all that?

1980
01:46:22,966 --> 01:46:25,719
I still need a new life.

1981
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,181
I came here to escape, but
the past keeps catching up.

1982
01:46:30,223 --> 01:46:32,392
I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.

1983
01:46:32,434 --> 01:46:35,437
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get over it.

1984
01:46:35,478 --> 01:46:39,691
I don't mean just you.

1985
01:46:40,316 --> 01:46:43,611
I understand.

1986
01:46:43,862 --> 01:46:45,655
I should thank you, though.

1987
01:46:45,697 --> 01:46:48,616
For what?

1988
01:46:49,242 --> 01:46:54,164
For being the nicest guy I ever dated.

1989
01:46:54,205 --> 01:46:58,126
That's kind of sad.

1990
01:46:58,543 --> 01:47:02,339
It is kind of sad.

1991
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:06,343
Bye, and stuff.

1992
01:47:06,384 --> 01:47:09,971
Yeah. And stuff.

1993
01:47:15,185 --> 01:47:17,979
Go, get her.

1994
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:19,522
What?

1995
01:47:19,564 --> 01:47:24,569
You've been fighting for her all along.

1996
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:26,821
But what about you?

1997
01:47:26,863 --> 01:47:30,158
I'll be fine.

1998
01:47:32,786 --> 01:47:37,582
I'm too cool for you anyway.

1999
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:41,753
/Ciao, Knives.

2000
01:47:41,795 --> 01:47:44,089
Go.

2001
01:47:48,593 --> 01:47:49,886
Hey.

2002
01:47:49,928 --> 01:47:54,432
Hey, mind if I tag along?

2003
01:47:54,891 --> 01:47:56,685
You want to come with me?

2004
01:47:56,726 --> 01:48:02,816
Yeah, I thought maybe
we could try again.

2005
01:48:24,504 --> 01:48:29,634
/Continue? Nine, eight, seven, six,

2006
01:48:29,676 --> 01:48:34,556
/five, four, three, two, one.
